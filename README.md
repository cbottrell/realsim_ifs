RealSim-IFS is a tool for generating survey-realistic integral-field spectroscopy (IFS) obvervations of galaxies from numerical  simulations of galaxy formation and evolution. The tool is designed primarily to emulate the observing strategies of major IFS galaxy surveys in astronomy. But it also offers the flexibility to design your own observing strategies. RealSim-IFS has built-in functions supporting SAMI and MaNGA IFU footprints. 

Full documentation (and justification) for the code is provided in Chapter 4 of my [PhD Thesis](https://dspace.library.uvic.ca/bitstream/handle/1828/11975/Bottrell_Connor_PhD_2020.pdf?sequence=5&isAllowed=y).
